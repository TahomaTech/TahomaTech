  <h1>Ryan Hendrickson - @TahomaTech</h1>
</div>

I'm Ryan and I was born and raised in Washington State! I find most parts about tech very interesting, which makes it easy for me to jump into new things, whether it's a new language, framework, fixing CI/CD pipelines, writing a bash script, or even trying to figure out why a server is acting up. 

I don't write much code outside of work, but that is something I am trying to change 😅

:speech_balloon: I believe that privacy and encryption are human rights that should be protected as such and should be implemented in every product to help preserve these rights.
