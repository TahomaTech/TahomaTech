# Ryan Hendrickson - @rynhndrcksn

Due to the ongoing mistreatment of those under U.S. Immigration & Customs Enforcement's (ICE) care and Microsoft/GitHub's refusal to cease working with them, I have deleted all my personal repositories besides this one, and have migrated everything to [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/rynhndrcksn). I will leave this readme up and may update it from time to time, but make no guarantee's or promises to do so.

**NOTE**: My college requires the use of GitHub for git repo's, so my school projects will be listed here as well as my GitLab.

I am a student in a Software Development Bachelors of Applied Science. I believe that privacy, and encryption are human rights that should be protected as such and should be implemented in every consumer product. My career path is currently undecided, though I find embedded systems the most interesting. Feel free to reach out if you have questions or I may be able to collaborate with you on something.
