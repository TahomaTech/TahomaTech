# Ryan Hendrickson - @rynhndrcksn

My college requires the use of GitHub for git repo's, so my school projects will be listed here as well as my [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/rynhndrcksn). My GitLab holds my personal projects and school projects in one area, while my GitHub primarly holds my school projects.

I am a student in a Software Development Bachelors of Applied Science. I believe that privacy and encryption are human rights that should be protected as such and should be implemented in every consumer product. My career path is currently undecided, though I find embedded systems and full stack web dev interesting. Feel free to reach out if you have questions or I may be able to collaborate with you on something.
