  <h1>Hi, I'm Ryan 👋🏻 👨🏻‍💻</h1>
</div>

I'm a software engineer that is passionate about open source and creating a welcoming environment for everyone in tech.
Some of my favorite technologies to work with include PHP, Symfony, and Go.

:speech_balloon: I believe that privacy and encryption are human rights that should be protected as such and should be implemented in every product to help preserve these rights.

## Current Projects
- [Go Starter Site](https://github.com/rynhndrcksn/go-starter-site).
- Contributing to [Symfony](https://symfony.com/) (when I have the time).
- My [dotfiles](https://github.com/rynhndrcksn/dotfiles).

## Recent Projects
- My [MacOS dotfiles](https://github.com/rynhndrcksn/dotfiles-macos).

## Writing
- Really the only place will be my personal website, where I plan to eventually have a tech blog up and running.

## Misc
- [Catppuccin](https://github.com/catppuccin/catppuccin) is the best theme (specifically Mocha). I don't make the rules 🤷‍♂️
