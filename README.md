# Ryan Hendrickson - @rynhndrcksn

Due to the ongoing mistreatment of those under U.S. Immigration & Customs Enforcement's (ICE) care and Microsoft/GitHub's refusal to cease working with them, I have deleted all my personal repositories besides this one, and have migrated everything to [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/rynhndrcksn). I will leave this readme up and may update it from time to time, but make no guarantee's or promises to do so.

**NOTE**: My college requires the use of GitHub for git repo's, so my school projects will be listed here as well as my GitLab.

I am a student in a Software Development Bachelors of Applied Science. I believe that privacy and encryption are human rights that should be protected as such and should be implemented in every consumer product. My career path is currently undecided, though I find embedded systems and full stack web dev interesting. Feel free to reach out if you have questions or I may be able to collaborate with you on something.

### Currently Learning:
- Data Stuctures in Java (Winter 2021)
- Back-end frameworks using [Fat-Free](https://fatfreeframework.com/3.6/home) (We learn Fat-Free as it isn't overwhelming and allows us to understand the concepts without getting bogged down by using a larger/more complicated framework).

### Comfortable in:
- Java
- Front End Web Development
  - HTML5
  - CSS3
    - Bootstrap 4
  - JavaScript
    - JQuery
    - Ajax
- Back End Web Development
  - PHP 7
    - Fat-Free
  - MySQL

### Setup:
- 2020 M1 MacBook Pro.
- Custom built desktop running Windows 10. Here are the [Specs](https://pcpartpicker.com/user/leaderelrond/saved/smtL23).

### IDE's:
- [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) for Java.
- [PHPStorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/phpstorm/) for my projects with school.
- [VSCodium](https://vscodium.com/) for personal web projects, C++, C, and as a general text editor.
